q-shorturl (q-surl)
====================
A *very* light web app for URL shortening, based on Django.
author: bububut@gmail.com

What's New
====================
v0.1: the first version, it works!

Server Configuration
(for first time use)
====================
1) install Django: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/
#Here're steps for Django on Apache and mysql. Do corresponding work if you wish to use other http server.
2) install mod_wsgi: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions
3) cd into q-shorturl
4) modify related fields in deploy/000-default to point to the right path, then put the file into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. If your Apache configuration is different, just merge the file into your httpd.conf
5) create an empty table in mysql with whatever name you like, for example surl
6) copy deploy/settings_local.py to your own folder. It's the local setting for your site. You can set mysql connection properties in it. Then copy your modified settings_local.py into getsurl/ and putsurl/
7) getsurl/manage.py syncdb --pythonpath=./
   putsurl/manage.py syncdb --pythonpath=./

Update
====================
Currently the code of q-surl is far from stable and will be changed from time to time. If you download a newer version of q-surl, just repeat step 6) above. Or if you wish to deploy to a remote server, just cd to the directory whereyou put the extracted q-shorturl folder, use command:
	q-shorturl/deploy/dabao.sh /path/to/your/settings_local.py
which will generate a tar file. Then just transfer it to your server and extract to the right position and restart the http service.
