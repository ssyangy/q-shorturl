q-shorturl (q-surl)
====================
A *very* light web app for URL shortening, based on Django.
author: bububut@gmail.com

What's New
====================
v0.1: the first version, it works!

Server Configuration
(for first time use)
====================
1) install Django: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/
#Here're steps for Django on Apache and mysql. Do corresponding work if you wish to use other http server.
2) install mod_wsgi: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions
3) cd into q-shorturl, following steps assume you keep staying this folder.
4) modify related fields in deploy/000-default to point to the right path, then 
   for Debian and Ubuntu: put file 000-default into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled 
   for different Apache configuration: copy the file into your httpd.conf
5) create an empty database in mysql with whatever name you like, for example surl
6) copy deploy/settings_local.py to your own folder. It's the local setting for your site. You can set mysql connection and other properties in it.
7) copy your modified settings_local.py into getsurl/ and putsurl/
8) execute django manage script to create tables. Option --pythonpath is required to point to q-shorturl/ folder 
   getsurl/manage.py syncdb --pythonpath=./
   putsurl/manage.py syncdb --pythonpath=./
#This is all you need to do for the first time setup. The sites should be available now. The Installation section is for code upgrade.

Installation
====================
Currently the code of q-surl is far from stable and will be changed from time to time. If you download a newer version of q-surl, just overwite the old ones and repeat step 7) above.
Or if you wish to deploy to a remote server, just cd to the directory where you put the extracted q-shorturl folder then run script dabao.sh. It's located in q-shorturl/deploy/, the argument is the settings_local.py you modified in step 6) last time:
	q-shorturl/deploy/dabao.sh /path/to/your/settings_local.py
This will generate a tar file. Then just transfer it to your server and extract to the right position and restart the http service.
